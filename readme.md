### Projects
#### Personal
* [Hockey Analytics Dashboards](https://github.com/holmesr19/canessiteui) - An Angular 8 front-end for the publicly available NHL API ([unofficial documentation](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi#game-ids)) that leverages Material Design and D3.js to allows users to easily find content they enjoy and craft data-driven narratives.
* [Hurricanes Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/HurricanesBot) - Deployed Matt Donders' Python [hockey game bot](https://github.com/mattdonders/nhl-twitter-bot) to a Google Cloud Compute instance that live-tweets all Carolina Hurricanes' game events (goals, penalties, period start and end, etc.)  
#### Coming Soon
* Personal Webpage - Full stack application using Python and Angular that features personal and professional information as well as a blog.
* Latin Language Analysis Tool - A powerful analysis engine built on the APIs exposed by [Latin WordNet](https://latinwordnet.exeter.ac.uk/) and the Perseus Project (Morpheus morphology API) that helps students and teachers read, annotate, save and export selections from popular pre-loaded texts or their own user-supplied passages. Pre-loaded texts come from [Perseus open data](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/download), which had to be converted from XML to JSON. That data itself is available in a separate repository.

#### Class Projects
* CSCI 335, [Ancient Graffiti Project](http://ancientgraffiti.org/about/) - Worked on a Maven project to create index pages  that display every graffito in Pompeii and Herculaneum alphabetically by description using Java servlets and JSP's.
* Latin 326, The Poetry of Ovid - This project began as a [scraper](https://github.com/holmesr19/Classics_scraper) that used Depth-First Search to scrape the contents of the [The Latin Library](theLatinLibrary.com). I then added on to the DFS scraper to analyze the poetry of Ovid using word2vec and other quantitative methods. 
* CSCI 250, Robotics with Arduino - Designed and constructed a remote control lawnmowing robot from scratch on a $400 budget using an Arduino, weed wacker, and various electronic and mechanical components.
* CSCI 317, Database Management - Constructed a relational database for a fictional car rental company using PostgreSQL on [pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb)
